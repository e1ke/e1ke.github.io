# üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èABOUT ME
Hi, I am Eike, Software Engineer since 2015.
I like developing Apps with **Flutter**, creating Backends with **Java Spring Boot** and diving into **DevOps** and Cloud-Engineering with new and reliable technologies.  
At home, I created a fully automated NON-Cloud Environment with KNX Bussystem, openHAB, Home Assistant, Zigbee and other shenanigans. My Home Lab consists of multiple Servers, running Proxmox, Kubernetes, DNS-Server, NGINX Reverse Proxy, Grafana, Node-Red, TrueNAS, Nextcloud, Unifi and many more.
